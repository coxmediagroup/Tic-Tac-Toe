THIS WAS AN EXERCISE IN USING JAVASCRIPT WITH FRAMEWORKS LIKE ANGULAR AND NODE. 
THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ONES THAT I HAVE NEVER REALLY USED BEFORE BEYOND READING THEORY THAT USED THEM FOR EXAMPLES. 
THIS IS MY FIRST EVER APP USING THEM.

NODE AND ALL PACKAGES REQUIRED MUCH BE INSTALLED
EXECUTE $> node install <package name>

TO RUN:
$> gradle clean node

Once deployed
Traverse to http://localhost:8080
