    usage: app.py [-h] [--debug] [--host HOST] [--port PORT]

    Tic Tac Toe: The Crucible

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit
      --debug      run app in debug mode
      --host HOST  host to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
      --port PORT  port to bind to (default: 5000)

I chose to use Flask as this is a relatively small app. I felt that Django would
be a bit overkill.

Setup
-----
1. Install the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app with `./app.py` (default host and port are 127.0.0.1:5000)
  * There are some cli args if you wish to change the default behavior
