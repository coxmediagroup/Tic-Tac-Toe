Running the Game
================

To run this project install the 'flask' module:

    pip install flask
    
If you don't have pip you should be able to get it with:

    easy_install pip
    
Then inside of the "app" folder run the "app.py" file on the command line. 

    python2.7 app.py
    

Go to http://localhost:5000 and have fun!


Notes
=====

To Develop this project I used:

* python 2.7.2
* flask 0.10.1

Flask and the flask dependencies are the only non-standard modules used.
I used Python 2.7 because I think more people are still using this and 
have this version installed on their computers.  
Optionally you can also run "server.py" which is the production version.
This uses the tornado library to serve the application. You will need to do:

    pip install tornado

I.E. seems hang on the built-in debug server, this is a known bug 
in one of the dependency libraries. To run the production mode simply:

    python2.7 server.py
    
Once again, this will also run at localhost, port 5000.

Test Notes:
==========

Visit http://localhost:5000/testai to test the ai. 
You should get something like this:

    {
      "cp_wins": 9591, 
      "ties": 409,
      "total_runs": 10000, 
      "user_wins": 0
    }
    
With the computer going first it should always win.


Browser Testing:
=================

* Chrome Latest: Working
* Firefox Latest: Working
* I.E. 11 and 8: Working if you run from server.py
