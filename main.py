# This is our expert system for selecting moves in Tic-Tac-Toe.
# The arguments 'computer_plays' indicates whether the computer is playing X or O.
# The argument 'move_count' indicates the number of moves that were made previously.
# The function returns two values:
#   - The first value is an integer 1-9 indicating the computer's move.
#   - The second value is a string to be displayed by the calling function.
#
# The strategy for X is as follows:
#   1. On the first move, select the upper left corner
#   2. If O plays to the center, select the lower right corner.
#       - Get 3 in a row if possible, block if necessary. Game will end in a tie unless O makes a mistake.
#   3. If O does not play to the center, choose another corner that threatens 3 in a row horizontally or vertically.
#       - On the next move, we can launch a double attack to win the game.
# The strategy for O is as follows:
#   1. On the first move, select the center square. If the center square is taken, select the upper left corner.
#   2. On subsequent moves, get 3 in a row if possible, and block if necessary.
#       - If X played to opposite corners in his first two moves, then choose a side square.
#       - Threaten a double attack, or block the opponent's double attack.
#       - If all else fails, select the first unoccupied square.
