I moved my changes into a branch named new/game.

Using the strategy outlined in the Tic Tac Toe wikipedia article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy

Using Python 2.7

UX is done using pygame 1.9.2. 288x288 game board split into 9 - 96x96 rects
96x96 player tiles. 

Play again dialog - buttons 60x30
Choose piece dialog 160x100 - butons 66x66

This was my first attempt at unit testing.
I was not sure how to apply unit tests to the pygame/UX stuff.
