I moved my changes into a branch named new/game.

Using the strategy outlined in the Tic Tac Toe wikipedia article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy

UX is done using pygame 1.9.2. 288x288 game board split into 9 - 96x96 rects
96x96 player tiles. 

Play again dialog - buttons 60x30
Choose piece dialog 160x100 - buttons 66x66

This was my first attempt at unit testing.
I was not sure how to apply unit tests to the pygame/UX stuff. 

Unit tests tested via "python -m unittest discover -v"
Unit tests tested via "nosetests"
Unit tests tested via Eclipse IDE PyDev module "Run As Python unit-test"

Tested using Eclipse IDE PyDev module running on OS X 10.7
Tested on the command-line under OS X 10.7 and Windows 7 x64

Using Python 2.7
Requires PyGame 1.9.1
