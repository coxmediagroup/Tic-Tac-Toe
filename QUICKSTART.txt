To run, you need python 2.6+ and Flash installed (SWF derived from OpenLaszlo Source)

QUICKSTART:

1) From the project directory, run "python ./ttt_server.py" to start the server

2) In your browser open "http://127.0.0.1:22222/index.html", which is all that is needed 

3) Reload to reset. Have fun!
