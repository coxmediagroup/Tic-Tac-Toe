A simple Tic-Tac-Toe application.  I'd like to start with the list of features:

FEATURES
- Ajax-driven for good UX
- Saves a running record of your losses and draws
- You can leave the page and return at a later time and the progress of your game will be saved
- Neato hand-drawn graphics!


What could've been done better:
If I had more time, I'd flesh out the documentation, clean up the code a bit and build-out unit tests.

The most notable thing that could've been done better is that this entire app (including state persistence) could've been done entirely in Javascript.  I didn't think that would be a very good showcase of my ability to work with Django, so I went the overkill route and made a DB-driven Python app.
