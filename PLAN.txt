* Project will be written in python and use the Tkinter library for the GUI
interface, since that comes default with every X11/Windows Python install.

The way I see it, this is pretty simple- since we don't have to win, and
just keep from losing, the algorithm becomes nearly trivial. While the game
is running:

- Is the center empty?
	- YES: Put an X in it
	- NO: Does the player have any two X's whose X/Y edges touch,
		or whose corners touch on the diagonal?
		- YES: Determine the line on which the player's X's touch,
			and place an X at the empty space at the end of the
			line
		- NO: Put an X in a random square
- (repeat)
