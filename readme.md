### Project Summary
To create an interactive tic-tac-toe game in which the computer can never lose.  

My goal is to present the game within the context of a Django website that implements a variety of common features.

### Project Site: [r2smart4u.herokuapp.com](http://r2smart4u.herokuapp.com)

##### Project Targets

1. Demonstrate a knowledge of Git/Github through frequent commits/expressive messages and feature branches.
  1. The features branches existed only on my local machine, but you can see their merge history in the timeline.
2. Demonstrate an awareness and appreciation of creating/using a shared development environment by wrapping the project within a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) VM.
3. Demonstrate knowledge of Python/Django by implementing the following functionalities within specific apps:
  1. User Registration / Management
  2. Communications
  3. Analytics
  4. Tic-Tac-Toe
4. Further demonstrate Django expertise through the implementation of some common 3rd party apps:
  1. South (for database management)
  2. Tasty-Pie (for API development)
5. Demonstrate deployment experience by making the project available on the web via Heroku.
6. Demonstrate the ability to write clearly and cohesively (I'm in trouble if I haven't accomplished this already).

For additional information on my development process, etc., please see the __init__.py/readme.md files within the various sub-directories.
