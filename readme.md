## Greetings
My name is Mike Dunn.  I normally go by the handle eikonomega, but since this repo is public, 
I put it under a super secret codename 'eikonalpha' so that I don't advertise to my current
employer that I'm interested in joining your team.

### Project Summary
To create an interactive tic-tac-toe game in which the computer can never lose.  

My goal is to present the game within the context of a Django website that implements many of the features that
I imagine many of your media sites would include.

##### Project Targets

1. Demonstrate a knowledge of Git/Github through frequent commits/expressive messages and feature branches.
2. Demonstrate an awareness and appreciation of creating/using a shared development environment by wrapping the project within a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) VM.
3. Demonstrate an awareness of Python/Django by implementing the following functionalities within specific apps:
  1. User Registration / Management
  2. Communications
  3. Analytics
4. Further demonstrate Django expertise through the implementation of some common 3rd party apps:
  1. South (for database management)
  2. Tasty-Pie (for API development)
5. Demonstrate deployment experience by making the project available on the web via Heroku.
6. Demonstrate the ability to write clearly and cohesively (I'm in trouble if I haven't accomplished this already).
