        A note about passing 'index' and 'play' parameters to include:
        The way you would normally access list-based indexes in Django templates is this:

           game.board.0

        However, in order to access them from the included template, you would have to do this:

           game.board.index

        Which will be interpreted as a dictionary based lookup
