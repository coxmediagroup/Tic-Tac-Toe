The algorithm used for this project is just simple heuristics, but it gets the job done. While it would have been fun to implement a MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, it would have taken far more time than I had available to be able to finish in time. Furthermore, this allows for a much more RESTful mechanism instead of having to generate and manage a game tree and state space.
