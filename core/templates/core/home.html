The algorithm used for this project is just simple heuristics, but it gets the job done. While it would have been fun to implement a MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, it would have taken far more time than I had available to be able to finish in time. Furthermore, this allows for a much more RESTful mechanism instead of having to generate and manage a game tree and state space.

Having had very little time to work on this project so far, its certainly not perfect. There is still much room for improvement in areas such as security, maintaining integrity of the game state, storing the state or results server-side, and a massive amount of error-checking is missing.
