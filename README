In order to use this (ttt) as a django app:
-- ttt_parent/templates needs to be set as a template dir.
-- ttt needs to be listed under installed apps.
-- resources needs to be served as/in MEDIA_ROOT
-- urls.py for your project needs (r'^ttt/', include('ttt.urls') ) as an item.

To play tic-tac-toe and either lose or tie, visit:
<yourserver>/ttt/ticTacToe/

Side note: several files in this repo are not needed by the app and are provided as resources. IE board_and_pieces.svg.

------------
Intructions:
1. Fork this repo on github.
2. Create an app that can interactively play the game of Tic Tac Toe against another player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to github and send me a pull request.
