Intructions:
1. Fork this repo on GitHub
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send us a pull request.

If you don't want to broadcast your intentions by forking this, feel free to clone it and work locally. Then, send us a tar.gz of your solution, including your .git folder so we can see your commit history.

We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your program as a Django app.

=====================
Instructions to play:

Probably install NVM - https://github.com/creationix/nvm
Install and use NodeJS version 10.12
Go to project directory > npm install
> grunt server

Notes:

TicTacBoard object has too much going on but figured we could refactor later (mainly taking out the ai logic and putting that somewhere else).
Only tested in Firefox and Chrome.
Does not use a lick of Django though I am willing to maybe save finished games or do some other type of logic in django upon further direction.
Test cases don't cover much but are there only to serve as an example.

Thanks for looking my name is CJ Goldsmith ( carlos.j.goldsmith@gmail.com ) and I was originally contacted by recruiter fareeha@technisoftconsulting.com
