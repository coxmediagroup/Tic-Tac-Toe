A program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human 
player and never lose.

Let us implement the solution in a client-server configuration. The client will
be comprised of a single web page that interacts with a simple web api. The web
api implementation will make use of Twisted Web, giving us easy implementation 
with minimal overhead. We could certainly use Twisted to serve the static files
as well, but let us keep somewhat to the 'best practices' and serve the static 
content with nginx. For traffic that is intended for the web API, we will have 
nginx proxy such requests to port 8080 where Twisted is listening (see nginx 
config in deploy/ directory). Everything as simple as possbile and no simpler.

This code is running (as of the time of this writing) out on Google Compute
Engine on a Debian GNU/Linux server (like God intended). You may visit it at
