DJTickyTack
===========

DJTickyTack is a Tic-Tac-Toe server built in python with Django.
Players can create or join any number of games, and play proceeds
asynchronously.

Although Tic-Tac-Toe is a rather silly application of this technology,
the software serves as prototype server for more advanced turn based
games, such as Chess, Checkers, or Go.

It provides both a rudimentary HTML interface and a RESTful API.

Requirements: # @TODO: urls and instructions
-------------

  python (developed with v 2.7)
  django (developed with v1.2.4)

  django-registration
  staticfiles

Running the Server
------------------

To set up the database (only required before the first run):

  python manage.py syncdb

To start the server:

  python manage.py runserver localhost:8888

Then go to:

  http://localhost:8888/


MinMaxMoe
=========

MinMaxMoe implements the rules of tic tac toe and a complete brute-force
solution to the game based on the minimax algorithm from game theory. It
can play you interactively in the shell, or can be scheduled to play
asynchronously on a DJTickyTack server.
