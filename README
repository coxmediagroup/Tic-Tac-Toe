The program (gtnw.py) is designed to run from the command line using a simple text display and interface.  

Included files are as follows:

1. gtnw.py - Main program, used to play the game.

2. gtnwfunctions.py - functions for the tic-tac-toe game

3. testResults.txt - test log showing that the game mechanics function properly

4. woprtest.py - tests the game functions and prints out results

----------

Since the goal is to never lose rather than maximize winning, it seems simplest to set up a few rules that will ensure this.  They are, in order: 

1. When possible, win.

2. When neccessary, block an opponent win.

3. Take the center.

4. Block double moves before they happen.

5. More double move exceptions.

6. Take the corners.

7. Go anywhere.
