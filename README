This version of Tic-Tac-Toe is written in Common Lisp.
For the best experience, you are encouraged to use Mac OS X or a Linux distro and install SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp).

Many distros package sbcl but if yours doesn't or you're on OS X you'll want to check out http://www.sbcl.org/.
Once that's installed and in your PATH you should be able to simply ./tic-tac-toe.lisp in the source directory.
