Intructions:
1. Fork this repo on GitHub
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send us a pull request.

If you don't want to broadcast your intentions by forking this, feel free to clone it and work locally. Then, send us a tar.gz of your solution, including your .git folder so we can see your commit history.

We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your program as a Django app.

Solution:
1. Implemented in pure client-side JavaScript, built upon the JSFiddle [here](http://jsfiddle.net/5wKfF/15/). To help with evaluation, the changes to the JSFiddle are separated across commits.
2. To run, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` and navigate to [localhost:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000).
3. Note that all games start with the human player making the first move.

Synopsis:
The solution takes a fuzzy logic approach to the problem. The algorithm watches the human player's moves, then blocks their winning possibility using the following logic:
1. Choose one of the winning rows, with a preference given to diagonal where the human player is seen to be progressing.
2. Choose one of the squares on that row, with a preference given to the square closer to opponent.
3. This repeats until either the automaton (O) wins against human (X), or the game leads to a tie, popularly called ``cat's game''.
