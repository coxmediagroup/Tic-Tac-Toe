I've implemented this using Django 1.3 without any database, so testing the Tic Tac Toe game should be pretty straightforward.

Unit tests are in a single django app (game), use the following command:
python manage.py test game

If you have Django 1.3 set up, using the UI should be simple. Run the following command:
python manage.py runserver

and visit http://localhost:8000/ with your browser (I only tested with Firefox. Make sure JavaScript is enabled).

Let me know if you have any issues.

Intructions:
1. Fork this repo on GitHub
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send us a pull request.

If you don't want to broadcast your intentions by forking this, feel free to clone it and work locally. Then, send us a tar.gz of your solution, including your .git folder so we can see your commit history.

We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your program as a Django app.
