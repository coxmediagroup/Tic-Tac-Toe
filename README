X's & O's (Tic Tac Toe)

The Python module xsos.py contains an interactive version of X's and O's where the player can choose which mark (X or O) the computer controls.

X always goes first (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) and the computer will never lose.

To play a game simply run xsos.py from the command line with `python xsos.py` from the directory that contains xsos.py

To simulate a set of games run sim.py with the number of games to play, e.g. `python sim.py 1000` from the directory that contains sim.py

To execute the doctests run tests.py, e.g. `python tests.py` from the directory that contains tests.py

Intructions:
1. Fork this repo on GitHub.
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send me a pull request.

We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your program as a Django app.

(Don't be offended when I don't actually pull. I will clone your repo and inspect it locally when I receive the request. This repo will be left solution-less for obvious reasons.)
