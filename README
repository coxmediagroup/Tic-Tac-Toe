Requirements to run: Python 2.7 and Django 1.3.
Go into the django-site folder and run "python manage.py runserver".
Then open your browser to localhost:8000 and you should be able to play the game.

Notice:
This django site doesn't run in Windows because of a Django bug with file-based sessions:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9084
To avoid any database setup, this app uses file-based sessions.
A work-around will be coded when I have some time to work on the project.
