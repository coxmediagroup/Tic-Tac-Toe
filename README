A program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human 
player and never lose.

Let us implement the solution in a client-server configuration. The client will
be comprised of a single web page that interacts with a simple web api. The web
api implementation will make use of Twisted Web, giving us easy implementation 
with minimal overhead. We could certainly use Twisted to serve the static files
as well, but let us keep somewhat to the 'best practices' and serve the static 
content with nginx. For traffic that is intended for the web API, we will have 
nginx proxy such requests to port 8080 where Twisted is listening.

We will allow our web api to grow organically as we implement our solution, but 
even as we begin, it seems reasonable that we will need one resource for 
creating new games and another one for communicating the plays that the human 
player makes.
