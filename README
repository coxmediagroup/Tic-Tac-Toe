Usage
-----

From the root of the project, execute the following:

    python tictactoe.py


Implementation Errata
---------------------
 
 - A cli interface was chosen for simplicity of implementation.

 - Code was developed against Python 2.6.  Usage on other versions of
   Python remains untested and may not work.

 - Code is partitioned into modules according to functionality.  No
   reason for this other than personal preference - the code is simple
   enough that a single module would have worked just as well.

 - Unit tests exist for most functionality, and where they are not
   present, manual testing was performed.


Running Tests
-------------

The included unit tests have the following dependencies:

 - nosetests
 - mocker
 - unittest2

Unit tests can be executed by running nosetests in the root of the project.
