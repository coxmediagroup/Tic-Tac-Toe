This is a fork from a coding challenge I did a couple years back. The challenge was to design a Tic-Tac-Toe game played against the computer, where the computer never loses, and which the results of each game are reported and recorded on the server.

The code here is a recently updated version, in which I've taken the old challenge and fleshed it out into a fully fledged web application. It has a Dojo-based front-end that simlulates the computer dialogue in the movie War Games (1983), which happens to feature a never-lose Tic-Tac-Toe game as part of the plot.

I recently updated the backend to use Flask, which I think is ideal for this kind of simple server application. In this case I needed only to define two routes. It gave me some practice writing MongoDB code for Flask as well, which is something I wanted to implement in a proof-of-concept demo.
