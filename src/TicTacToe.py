#Board Class: A class to represent a simple 3x3 tic-tac-toe board. Essentially, it provides an 
#interface to the board data structure to ensure that only valid moves are read and written. 
#It is also able to 'print' itself. 
class Board:
    pass

#Make Next Move Function: Algorithm that makes computer player's next move, and modifies the board
#accordingly. 
def MakeNextMove(gameBoard):
    pass

#Is Game Over Function: Algorithm for determining if the game is over.
def isGameOver(gameBoard):
    pass

#Main Function. Procedure for playing a game. Ties together Board, AI, and user input. 
if __name__ == '__main__':
