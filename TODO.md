I have some homework to work on, so I will have to work on this more over the weekend.

I was going to implement this with Python and PyGame, but apparently PyGame's website is down? D:
Are they dead? Who knows!

# To Do

1. Add player / computer X / O placement and turn-taking
1. Add end-condition and checking who has won the match
1. Implement stategy for computer to never lose...
    1. Computer goes first
        1. Computer mark center
            1. etc.
        1. Computer mark corner
		    1. etc.
    1. Player goes first
        1. If player marks center, computer mark a corner
        1. If player marks a corner, computer marks the center
        1. If player marks an edge, computer marks the center ?
1. Add a reset button

I'm trying to use the strategies mentioned on [This WikiHow page](http://www.wikihow.com/Win-at-Tic-Tac-Toe)
