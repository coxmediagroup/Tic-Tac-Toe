Story
======

As an applicant, I created this game of Tic Tac Toe to demonstrate my skills and strengths as a developer.

Acceptance criteria
=======================

* The AI will never lose
* This submission must includes both server & client side code.

Technical notes
------------------

* This game is implemented as a Django app.
* Due to the simplicity of the game logic and the lack of any security concerns, there is no database or any sort of data persistence in the back-end.
* The AI employs a minimax (negamax) algorithm to find an appropriate move.
* The front-end is built entirely using Django html templates and css.

Instructions
============

* Download from GitHub
* Install Python 3 and Django
* Navigate to repository main directory
* Execute> python manage.py runserver [ip:port]
* In a web browser, navigate to ip:port (default is 127.0.0.1:8000)
