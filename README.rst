Program notes
=======================
Download & run app.py in your terminal. Fire up a localhost in your browser and try to beat the computer.

Uses Flask's dev server for quick & easy local testing, and Bootstrap 3 styles (though it is not currently responsive, 
and the styling is quite rudimentary).

No session states because this amount of data doesn't really need it. Instead, the whole board gets passed 
from the front to back end and back again every time.

Split into two branches after first pass at the logic because it became obvious the direction I was going was wrong.
The redeux commits are in the "refactor" branch.
