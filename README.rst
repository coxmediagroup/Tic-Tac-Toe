Tic-Tac-Toe
===========
This is tic-tac-toe_ as a client-server Django app.

The user loads the front page, and clicks a button to decide if they want to
go first ('X') or second ('O').  The user and the app take turns adding X's
and O's to a three-by-three grid until the app wins.  The user can then
start a new game.

Purpose
-------
This project was created as a `programming exercise`_ for a `job application`_.
The requirements are:

* The AI should never lose
* The submission must include both server & client side code -- no CLI-only
  or browser-only implementations.
* Quality counts! A good submission that takes a while is better than a poor
  submission quickly.
* You should include clear instructions for how to run your application

When I was first recruited, I was too busy to write code, but I did have about
2 months to think about the problem before I started.
