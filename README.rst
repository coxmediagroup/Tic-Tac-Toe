Andrew Schoen - Unwinnable Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge
------------------------------------------------

I used flask and backbone.js to complete the challenge.  To run the flask app 
locally, follow these steps.

* clone the repo, cd into it's directory
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python tictactoe.py
* open up localhost:5000 in a browser
