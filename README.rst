================================
 CMG Tic-tac-toe Code Challenge
================================

Intructions
-----------

1. Fork this repo on GitHub.
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against
   a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send me a pull request.

If you don't want to broadcast your intentions by forking this, feel free to
clone it and work locally. Then, send us a tar.gz of your solution, including
your .git folder so we can see your commit history.

We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your
program as a Django app.

(Don't be offended when I don't actually pull. I will clone your repo and
inspect it locally when I receive the request. This repo will be left
solution-less for obvious reasons.)


TODO
----

Along with all the FIXME and TODO notes in the code:

* Write form/form field for better handling game and grid.
* Refactor Player.next_turn code.
* Write tests for everything.
* Create custom manager for game to access games based on status.
* Flesh out templates.
* Prettify with Bootstrap.
* Install South.
* Write initial data migration. (Setup my user, site, etc.)
* Add travis-ci support.
