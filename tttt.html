		 * AI move algorithm:
		 * Check and take win if possible (player has any two positions in a win, take the third
		 * If no win, check and take block if required. (Opponent has any two positions in a win, take the third. Logic for win and block are the same!)
		 * No, then take 11 if available.
		 * if not 11 then
		 * 	if previous move was [01,10,12,21] take [00,20,02,22]
		 * 	if previous move was [00,02,22,20] take [01,12,21,10] match row or column if available, otherwise take nearest
		 * last option, take any free position.
		 *
		 * After each move, check for win. If win, game over with winner.
		 * 	if no win, check for full board. If full, game over with draw.
		 * Wins:
		 * [0,1,2][0,1,2]	//rows AND columns
		 * 00,11,22 diagonal 1
		 * 20,11,02 diagonal 2
