Algorithm for interactions between a server and a human player.


Note: Everything is event based!!
Note: The server keeps info on who is to make a next move. 'playerMakeMove=[human, machine]'

1) The machine player is already available to play.

2) Human joins the game.

3) The server sends an empty board and asks the human to play first.
  server.sendBoardStateToPlayers()    data='boardState'

4) The human makes first move. Sends this info to the server. Server updates the board accordingly. Now the server knows that it is machine's turn. (based on event).
  client.sendMyMoveToServer()         data='nextMove'
  server.receiveMoveFromPlayer()

5) The server sends out info on updated board to all.
  server.sendBoardStateToPlayers()    data='boardState'

6) Once the human gets the updated board, updates the UI.

7) The machine makes next move. Sends this info to the server.
  server.receiveMachineMakeMove()

8) The server sends out info on updated board to all.
  server.sendBoardStateToPlayers()

9) Once the human gets the updated board, updates the UI.
