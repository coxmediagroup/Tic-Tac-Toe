Possibilities for future development:
=====================================

- Generalize the UI to allow:
  - Implementing a Django-based interface
  - Implementing a desktop GUI interface
- Add caching and/or special-casing to improve AI performance
- Determine whether it's possible to build a version of the AI that can
  successfully avoid winning /or/ losing, forcing a draw every time
- Implement a version of the AI that is content to choose randomly from all
  non-losing options
- Add regression tests with the unittest framework
